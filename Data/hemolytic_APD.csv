Removal of the C-terminal residues 18-28 or changing residues 22,25,and 26 to K disrupted hemolytic activity of the peptide (Shin et al 2001 BBRC 285: 1046).

Ovispirin-1 (KNLRRIIRKIIHIIKKYG) was designed based on SMAP-29. Design: Ovispirin-1 (OV-1) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide similar to SMAP-29. OV-2 and OV-3 are shortened or mutated versions of OV-1 (Saiman L et al 2001 Antimicrob Agent Chemother. 45: 2838-44).  However, novispirin, obtained by changing residue I10 of OV-1 to G10, can kill bacteria rapidly but is relatively nontoxic to human cells (Sawai MV et al 2002 Protein Engineering 15: 225-232).

The relationship of human LL-37 with cancer is complex (Reviewed by Wu et al. 2010). While LL-37 could promote cancer metastasis in certain cases, its fragment (FK-16) have been documented to have anti-cancer effects (Li et al., 2006). 
Discovery: molecular formula of LL-37: C205H341N59O53; Mol. Wt. 4493.312; molar extinction coefficient = 0. Discovered in 1995 by three labs (see the ref;  Cowland JB et al. 1995;  Larrick JW et al. 1995). The precursor protein is human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 kDa (hCAP-18).  The mature peptide released by proteinase 3 is referred to as LL-37 (Gudmundsson GH et al., 1996), which is two residues shorter than the predicted form FALL-39 (old). Activity: Active against bacteria (E. coli. B. thailandensis, A. baunmannii, H. pylori, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, P. gingivalis, Y. pestis, B. anthracis, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. mutans, M. tuberculosis (anti-TB), M. smegmatis, M. bovis, L. casei, L. monocytogenes, M. luteus, P. acnes, T. denticola, T. palidum, Y. pestis, A. xylosoxidans, B. suis, F. novicida, F. nucleatum, L. interrogans, Group A streptococcus, Group B streptococcus), fungi (C. albicans), viruses (HIV-1; Herpes Simplex Virus , HSV-1; respiratory syncytial virus, RSV; influenza virus; human adenovirus, HAdV; dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2)), Zika virus; the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Brice et al., 2018); Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (Ahmed A et al. 2019); parasites (e.g., E. histolytica), cancer cells. It inhibits F. novicida biofilms in vitro even at 0.24 ug/ml based on CV staining (Amer LS et al., 2010) (EC50 50 nM). It inhibits biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa below MIC (0.05 ug/ml) (Overhage J et al., 2008;Dean SN et al., 2011). It can also kill sperms, a possible spermicidal agent for developing a potential vaginal contraceptive  (Srakaew N et al., 2014). It shows synergistic effect with defensins or lysozyme.  
Structure: At an acidic condition, LL-37 is disordered, but becomes tetramer (involving residues 2-36) at elevated pH (~7) (Li et al., 2007). This tetramer is maintained in zwitterionic membranes but dissociated in anionic bacterial membranes (Oren et al. 1999 Biochem J 341:501-513). Upon association with bacterial outer membrane component LPS or inner membrane component PG, LL-37 adopts a long helix covering residues 2-31 with a disordered C-terminal tail. The membrane-bound high-resolution structure of LL-37 is determined by 3D NMR in the presence of SDS or D8PG using 13C,15N-labeled sample (Wang G, 2008). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. 
Sunlight and vitamin D are good: The expression of LL-37 is transcriptionally regulated by vitamin D (Karlsson J et al. 2008), sunlight, and other factors. The administration of vitamin D (25D3) as supplement (leading to cathelicidin expression in epithelial cells) may prevent unitary tract infection (UTI) (Hertting, O et al. 2010). Other AMP inducing factors are listed here.
Beyond antimicrobials: In addition to antimicrobial and anti-septic effects, LL-37 also possesses multiple other functions such as chemotaxis (e.g. to monocytes; T cells; peripheral blood neutrophils; eosinophils) via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) (Yang D et al., 2000), mast cells via MrgX2 (Subramanian et al., 2011), activates CXCR2 receptor of neutrophils, purinergic receptor P2X7 in fibroblasts, and insulin growth factor receptor in epithelial cells, promotes wound healing, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and  immune modulation. LL-37 can also associate with human apolipoprotein A-I, F-actin and DNA and becomes inactive (reviewed by Wang, G 2007). The binding of LL-37 to LPS modulates the signal transduction via the TLR4 pathway, while its binding to bacterial DNA works via the TLR9 pathway.   
Post-translational modification: Arginines of LL-37 can get citrullinated (Kilsgrd et al., 2012), weakening its ability in preventing endotoxin-induced sepsis (Koziel J et al., 2014). Also, up to four out of the five arginines of LL-37 can be ADP-ribosylated, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Picchianti et al., 2015). LL-37 may also be carbamylated (Koro et al., 2016). LL-37 can be cleaved by multiple proteases such as cathepsins S and K. However, it inhibits cathepsin L (Andrault PM et al., 2015). 
Surface immobilization: LL-37 has also been covalently immobilized 2006 Gabriel M et al.  to the titanium surface. So are KR-12 (the minimal antimicrobial peptide), IG-25 that corresponds to residues 13-37 of LL-37, and the major antimicrobial region FK-16 (GF-17 minus N-terminus G) (Mishra and Wang, 2017).  
The LL-37 story will surely continue to evolve. Found in multiple species. Also see ALL-38. APD update 12/2010; 11/2011; 2/2012; 8/2012; Jan2013; 4/2013; 5/2014; 9/2014; Jan2015; 12/2015; 2/2016; 4/2016; 10/2016; 3/2017; 6/2017; 8/2017; 12/2017; Jan2018; 8/2018; 10/2018; 2/2019  GW.

BMAP-28 has broad antimicrobial activities and confers protection in an animal model:mouse of bacterial infection or sepsis (Giacometti A et al. 2004 Crit Care Med 32, 2485-90). Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular L. major amastigotes within a macrophage infection model. Interestingly, the D-amino acid form is more active against parasites than either BMAP-28 (the L form) or the sequence reversed form (Lynn MA et al 2011 PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 5(5):e1141). Trucation of the C-terminal tail  reduced hemolysis.

Cellular location: accumulated in vacuole and processed likely by asparaginyl endoproteinase (Conlan BF et al. 2011 Am J Bot 98:2018-26). Structure: there are other PDB entries: 1JJZ, 1NB1, and 1ZNU. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 4TTM structure here in the PDB . Antibacterial activity was salt dependent and the peptide was most active against S. aureus (0.26 uM). The overall fold is important for anti-HIV activity, since the acyclic permutant is inactive. Kalata B1 also has uterotonic and insecticidal activity (natural pesticide). (MOA) An all D-analog is also active, supporting membrane targeting (Sando L. et al. 2011 Chembiochem 12: 2456-62). NMR studies of the ternary complex identified amino acid residues in loop 5 (W23, P24, and V25) and loop 6 (L2, P3, and V4) are important for membrane binding (Shenkarrev ZO et al. 2006 FEBS J 273:2658-72). It binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and leads to pore formation (41-70 A) in lipid bilayers (Huang et al 2009 JBC 284: 20699-20707). Oligomerization on the membrane surface could be important for this process. Note that oxidized forms of this peptide have also been reported. Trp can be oxidized to oxindolylalanine I (oia) or N-formylkynurenine (nfk). The effect of such oxidation on activity is unknown (Plan MR et al 2007 Chembiochem 8:1001-11).

The cytolysin consists of two structural subunits, CylLL and CylLS, that are activated by an extracellular protease, CylA.  In the absence of target cells, the other subunit (CylL(L)'') forms a complex with CylL(S)'', blocking it from autoinducing the operon. When target cells are present, however, CylL(L)'' binds preferentially to the target, allowing free CylL(S)'' to accumulate above the induction threshold to express high levels of cytolysin (Coburn PS et al., 2004). The two chains work synergistically at a ratio of 1:1. CylLS contains two thioether bonds: T1-C5 and S17-C20. In addition, T2 and T7 are dehydrated.
