A S-S bond led to a CYCLIC DODECAPEPTIDE, which is more active against gram- bacteria.  Only linearized versions of the peptides (Bac2A, obtained by converting the two Cys residues to Ala residues, plus C-terminal amidation) showed activtiy against Gram+ bacteria such as S. epidermidis and E. facaelis. The linearized or reduced forms appeared to be more effective in dissipating the membrane potential (Wu M and Hancock,RE 1999 JBC 274: 29-35). Like NaD1, Bac2A is unable to disrupt SUVs and interacts with intracellular targets yet to be identified (van der Weerden et al. 2010 JBC 285:37513-20).

Also, Bac7(116) was an equally potent inhibitor as Bac7(135), consistent with the similar MICs observed for these two derivatives. Mechanism of action:  At ~MIC, the fragment binds to internal targets via stereospecific uptake (because all-D-enantiomer failed to be taken in and much less active); at higher concentrations, it works via non-specific membranolytic mechanism. Bac(1-16) is still active against E. coli and S. enterica but kinetically deficient compared to bac(1-35). Bac(5-35) is much less active, indicating the importance of the N-terminal segment (Biochim Biophys Acta 2006; 1760: 1732-1740). Crystal structures of Bac 7 fragments in complex with E. coli Dnak have been solved [PDB ID 4JWC (use the PDB link below) for Bac7(1-16) and 4JWD for Bac7(15-28 )].

Also active against E. coli ATCC 2592, M. luteus, and S. cerevisae (Ke T et al., 2012). Active against fungal biofilms (A. fumigatus, F. solani, and C. albicans) (Sengupta J et al., 2012).

This contrasts with X-ray structure where residues 1-13 is helical. Thus, this peptide appears to be able to adopt a different conformation depending on environmental conditions. lactoferrin (Lf) peptide 2 is a derivative corresponding to residues 1-10 of LfcinB (Ueta E, Tanida T, Osaki T.2001 A novel bovine lactoferrin peptide, FKCRRWQWRM, suppresses Candida cell growth and activates neutrophils. J Pept Res 2001 Mar;57(3):240-9).  LfcinB6 (sequence: RRWQWR) corresponds to residues 4-9 of the peptide. Structure of LfcinB6 was determined in SDS micelles (Vogel HJ et al 2002 Biochem Cell Biol 80:49-63). Free LfcinB6 did not kill T-leukemia or breast cancer cells, but LfcinB6 was strongly cytotoxic when delivered to the cytosolic compartment by fusogenic liposomes (Richardson A 2009 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 21). In vivo efficacy:Animal model:mouse: Injection of a 9-mer derivative, LTX-302, led to tumor necrosis, infiltration of inflammation, and complete regression in the majority of mice (Berge G et al., 2010 Cancer Immunol Immunother 59: 1285-94).  Appending hepta-arginine sequence via a glycine-glycine linker generates a more selective peptide MPLfcinB6 against  human T-leukemia and B-lymphoma cells by damaging cell membranes (Hilchie AL et al., 2013).

Disulfide-bridge formation is indispensable for antimicrobial activity and is closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 2;369(2):609-15). The S-S bond is also important for salt tolerance and for pore formation in membranes. C-terminal amidation had little effect. However, P. aeruginosa is 8-fold more sentive to the C-terminally amidated form. Antimicrobial activity decreases with the removel of more and more N-terminal residues (3 to 9). An all-D-enantiomer is almost inactive against Gram- bacteria but is fully active against fungi and some Gram+ bacteria, suggesting microbe-dependent mechanisms of action. Thanatin is not hemolytic. A hairpin-like structure was found in solution (Mandard et al 1998 Eur J Biochem 256: 404). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. A T15S mutant (S-thanatin) binds LPS. MOA: in 2019, it is found that thanatin can compete for LPS with divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are essential for membrane integrity. It also binds to the NDM-1 mettllo-beta-lactamase to replace Zn2+, inhibiting the hydrolase activity of this pathogen enzyme. This peptide also sensitizes the activity of antibiotics (Ma B et al., 2019). Trangenic plants: the thanatin transformant acquired a sufficient level of resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, presumably due to the repressive activity of thanatin to its initial stage of infection (Imamura T et al. 2010 Transgenic Res. 19:415-24). Recombinant thanatin is also active against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) (Sabokkhiz MA et al. 2019).

In the synthetic peptide used for activity assays, the last Gly residue was converted to NH2 (more precisely, SMAP-28).  Removal of the C-terminal residues 18-28 or changing residues 22,25,and 26 to K disrupted hemolytic activity of the peptide (Shin et al 2001 BBRC 285: 1046). In TFE, residues 8-17 are helical, residues 18-19 serves as a hinge, and residues 20-28 are ordered (Tack BF et al. 2002 Eur J Biochem 269: 1181).

Immobilization: The peptide has been immobilized to superparamagnetic beads and glass with antimicorbial activity (Soares et al., 2015). Ovispirin-1 (KNLRRIIRKIIHIIKKYG) was designed based on SMAP-29. Design: Ovispirin-1 (OV-1) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide similar to SMAP-29. OV-2 and OV-3 are shortened or mutated versions of OV-1 (Saiman L et al 2001 Antimicrob Agent Chemother. 45: 2838-44).  However, novispirin, obtained by changing residue I10 of OV-1 to G10, can kill bacteria rapidly but is relatively nontoxic to human cells (Sawai MV et al 2002 Protein Engineering 15: 225-232).

Native pyrrhocoricin is largely disordered in solution with a subpopulation of ordered turns over residues 2-5, 4-7, and 16-19 based on NMR studies. The N-terminal region, residues 2-10, is important for activity, while the C-terminal half of the peptide is important for cell entrance. For the structure of the active region residues 1-10 in complex with the E. coli heat shock protein DnaK, see the PDB link. MOA:The peptide appears to target DnaK within bacteria via the N-terminal active region. All-D form is inactive, so not targeting bacterial membranes for killing. However, this peptide may acutally inhibit translationa process in the cell-free E. coli protein synthesis system (Taniguchi M et al., 2016).  The macrocyclic derivative incorporates a nine amino acid linker joining the N- and C-termini, which does not adversely affect the antimicrobial potency but leads to a broader spectrum of activity (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237).

Turn elements occur near residues 4-7, 10-13, 17, and 18. At modorate concentrations, this peptide, as well as pyrrhocoricin (AP170), is also active against a few  bacteria such as B. megaterium (44% homology to E. coli DnaK D-E helix) and M. luteus, E. coli D31 (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM) (Hoffmann R et al. 1999 Biochim Biophys Acta 1426:459-67).

Note that all D-drosocin is inactive (so a non-membrane target) and the L form kills bacteria in hours not in minutes. Recently, it is demonstrated that this apidaecin-type peptide and its analog Dros (sequence: GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV) blocks the assembly of the large (50S) subunit of the ribosome, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015).

Structure: The 3 disulfide bonds are between residues 2-30, 4-19, and 9-29. S-S bond pattern: Cys1Cys6, Cys2Cys4, and Cys3Cys5.

You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structure here in the PDB. There are multiple structures for HNP1 mutants or derivatives in the PDB.  MOA1: the L- and D-forms of HNP-1 (crystal structures are true mirror images) are equally active against E. coli (D=L), indicating membrane targeting. However, they displayed different activity against S. aureus. Subsequently, it was found that HNP-1 binds to cell wall precursor lipid II (dee Leeuw et al. 2010 FEBS Lett 584: 1543). MOA2: Although it is a lectin and binds to gp120 and CD4, HNP-1 was found to show inhibitory effects after HIV-1 entry (Wang et al. 2004 J Immunol 173: 515). MOA3: it inhibits non-enveloped BK virus infection by aggregating virions and blocking binding to host cells (JBC 2008; 283: 31125-31132). These examples indicate that the mechanisms of action of AMPs could depend on the type of organisms.  PTM: Arginine can be ADP-ribosylated and HNP1 became less antimicrobial and cytotoxic, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Paone et al., 2002).

This cationic cluster of HNP4 is also important for HNP4 killing of S. aureus, inhibition of anthrax lethal factor  (LF) and binding to LF and gp120. In addition, N-methylation of Leu20 to destabilize the HNP4 dimer had little effect on E. coli killing, but significantly reduced the ability of HNP4 to kill S. aureus, inhibit LF, and bind to LF and gp120 (Hu et al., 2019).

histidine-27, according to x-ray crystallographic studies. You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure of the wild-type HD-6 here in the PDB. You can also rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the His27 mutant here.  However, you need look at the figures in the published paper for the crystal packing of the monomers. These findings support a key role for HD6 in protecting the small intestine against invasion by diverse enteric pathogens and may explain the conservation of HD6 throughout Hominidae evolution  Science 2012. Second, HD-6 is a true AMP that kills bacteria under a reduced environmental conditions (Schroeder BO et al., 2014). Activity was observed against anaerobic gut commensals but not against some pathogenic strains. An APD recommended reading. APD update 6/2012; 2/2014; 2/2015; 10/2015.

In addition to antibacterial effects, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 or CCR6 expressing cells (Rohr J et al. 2010 J Immunol 184:6688-94). It contains three disulfide bonds and  a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. These bridges are needed for chemotactic but not antibacterial activity.  It is a dimer in solution, which may be responsible for high antibacterial activity. Cf. HBD1 and HBD2 are monomers in solution (Schibli DJ et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277: 8279). Structure: Delete the double arginines RR at the C-terminus of hBD-3 or shifting them to the N-terminus reduced peptide activity against S. aureus by 5 fold (Sakagami-Yasui Y et al., 2017). S-S bond pattern: Cys1Cys5, Cys2Cys4, and Cys3Cys6. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.  Mechanism: MOA:bacteria: This peptide inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Staphylococci (Sass V et al 2010 Infect Immu 78: 2793-800).   MOA:virus: Its anti-HIV-1 effect may be due to a direct interaction with virions and through modulation of the CXCR4 co-ceceptor (Weinberg et al 2006 Adv Dent Res 19: 42-8).

Also Active against C. albicans, P. pastoris,  C. krusei, A. flavus, and F. solani. Also active against F. graminearum (see ref for AP2428). This peptide is unable to permeabilize liposomes (vesicles). Activity of Rs-AFP1 to Rs-AFP3 reduced in the presence of metal ions. The activity is related to the level of sphingolipid glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the fungal membranes (Ravares PM 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 52: 4522-4525) since alteration of the structure of GlcCer or deletion of GlcCer led to poor activity. The Y38G mutant is not active against fungi, but retains the ability to interact with GlcCer, indicating binding to fungal membranes is necessary but not sufficient to kill fungi (De Samblanx GW et al 1997 J Biol Chem 272: 1171-1179). Recently, Aerts et al (2007 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 13: 243-7) showed that interaction of RsAFP2 with fungal GlcCer triggers a signal transduction pathway, leading to the production of  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fungal death. These data support the two-step model for the mode of action (MOA) of RsAFP2. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco/tomato  improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).

Lower levels of LL-37 in serum are correlated with RSV and severity of bronchiolitis and viral etiology (Mansbach et al., 2017). The relationship of human LL-37 with cancer is complex (Reviewed by Wu et al. 2010). While LL-37 could promote cancer metastasis in certain cases, its fragment (FK-16) have been documented to have anti-cancer effects (Li et al., 2006). 
Discovery: molecular formula of LL-37: C205H341N59O53; Mol. Wt. 4493.312; molar extinction coefficient = 0. Discovered in 1995 by three labs (see the ref;  Cowland JB et al. 1995;  Larrick JW et al. 1995). The precursor protein is human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 kDa (hCAP-18).  The mature peptide released by proteinase 3 is referred to as LL-37 (Gudmundsson GH et al., 1996), which is two residues shorter than the predicted form FALL-39 (old). Activity: Active against bacteria (E. coli. B. thailandensis, A. baunmannii, H. pylori, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, P. gingivalis, Y. pestis, B. anthracis, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. mutans, M. tuberculosis (anti-TB), M. smegmatis, M. bovis, L. casei, L. monocytogenes, M. luteus, P. acnes, T. denticola, T. palidum, Y. pestis, A. xylosoxidans, B. suis, F. novicida, F. nucleatum, L. interrogans, Group A streptococcus, Group B streptococcus), fungi (C. albicans), viruses (HIV-1; Herpes Simplex Virus , HSV-1; respiratory syncytial virus, RSV; influenza virus; human adenovirus, HAdV; dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2)), Zika virus; the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Brice et al., 2018); Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (Ahmed A et al. 2019); parasites (e.g., E. histolytica), cancer cells. Antibacterial activity of LL-37 is serum-susceptible and become inactive in human serum due to binding to serum proteins. It inhibits F. novicida biofilms in vitro even at 0.24 ug/ml based on CV staining (Amer LS et al., 2010) (EC50 50 nM). It inhibits biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa below MIC (0.05 ug/ml) (Overhage J et al., 2008;Dean SN et al., 2011). It can also kill sperms, a possible spermicidal agent for developing a potential vaginal contraceptive  (Srakaew N et al., 2014). It shows synergistic effect with defensins or lysozyme.  
Structure: At an acidic condition, LL-37 is disordered, but becomes tetramer (involving residues 2-36) at elevated pH (~7) (Li et al., 2007). This tetramer is maintained in zwitterionic membranes but dissociated in anionic bacterial membranes (Oren et al. 1999 Biochem J 341:501-513). Upon association with bacterial outer membrane component LPS or inner membrane component PG, LL-37 adopts a long helix covering residues 2-31 with a disordered C-terminal tail. The membrane-bound high-resolution structure of LL-37 is determined by 3D NMR in the presence of SDS or D8PG using 13C,15N-labeled sample (Wang G, 2008). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. 
Sunlight and vitamin D are good: The expression of LL-37 is transcriptionally regulated by vitamin D (Karlsson J et al. 2008), sunlight, and other factors. The administration of vitamin D (25D3) as supplement (leading to cathelicidin expression in epithelial cells) may prevent unitary tract infection (UTI) (Hertting, O et al. 2010). Other AMP inducing factors are listed here.
Beyond antimicrobials: In addition to antimicrobial and anti-septic effects, LL-37 also possesses multiple other functions such as chemotaxis (e.g. to monocytes; T cells; peripheral blood neutrophils; eosinophils) via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) (Yang D et al., 2000), mast cells via MrgX2 (Subramanian et al., 2011), activates CXCR2 receptor of neutrophils, purinergic receptor P2X7 in fibroblasts, and insulin growth factor receptor in epithelial cells, promotes wound healing, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and  immune modulation. LL-37 can also associate with human apolipoprotein A-I, F-actin and DNA and becomes inactive (reviewed by Wang, G 2007). The binding of LL-37 to LPS modulates the signal transduction via the TLR4 pathway, while its binding to bacterial DNA works via the TLR9 pathway.   
Post-translational modification: Arginines of LL-37 can get citrullinated (Kilsgrd et al., 2012), weakening its ability in preventing endotoxin-induced sepsis (Koziel J et al., 2014). It has been proved that citrullinated LL-37 can be detected when healthy people are exposed to LPS (Al-Adwani et al., 2020). Also, up to four out of the five arginines of LL-37 can be ADP-ribosylated, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Picchianti et al., 2015). LL-37 may also be carbamylated (Koro et al., 2016). LL-37 can be cleaved by multiple proteases such as cathepsins S and K. However, it inhibits cathepsin L (Andrault PM et al., 2015). 
Surface immobilization: LL-37 has also been covalently immobilized 2006 Gabriel M et al.  to the titanium surface. So are KR-12 (the minimal antimicrobial peptide), IG-25 that corresponds to residues 13-37 of LL-37, and the major antimicrobial region FK-16 (GF-17 minus N-terminus G) (Mishra and Wang, 2017).  
The LL-37 story will surely continue to evolve. Found in multiple species. Also see ALL-38.

In addition, BMAP-18 ( i.e. N-terminal 18-residues of BMAP-27) is HIV-active. Further deletion of three C-terminal residues from BMAP-18 led to a peptide (BMAP-15) that is inactive to HIV-1 (Wang, G., et al. 2008. Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy 52: 3438-3440).

BMAP-28 has broad antimicrobial activities and confers protection in an animal model:mouse of bacterial infection or sepsis (Giacometti A et al. 2004 Crit Care Med 32, 2485-90). Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular L. major amastigotes within a macrophage infection model. Interestingly, the D-amino acid form is more active against parasites than either BMAP-28 (the L form) or the sequence reversed form (Lynn MA et al 2011 PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 5(5):e1141). Trucation of the C-terminal tail  reduced hemolysis.  Of note, a modified peptide (mBMAP-28) was also synthesized by replacing the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (residues 20-28) with a more hydrophilic sequence QATPATRQ also reduced peptide cell selectivity. BMAP-28 is also antiviral (e.g., simplex virus type 1, HSV-1) (Benincasa et al., 2003).

The first theta-defensin reported. It is a two gene ligation product. RTD-1 is most abundant (~50% of the RTD content; the ratio of RTD1, -2, and 3 are 29:1:2). Total RTD content varied by 3 fold between animals (see ref for AP1074). It contains three disulfide bonds: 3,16; 5,14; 7,12. The molecule self associates in water in a concentration-depedent manner.  Initially thought flexible (PDB ID: 1HVZ), the refined 3D structure revealed a rigid beta-hairpin structure (PDB ID: 2LYF; Conibear AC et al., 2012).  You can rotate, zoom, and view the refined 3D structure here in the PDB. Antibacterial activity of this circular molecule is salt-insensitive compared to non-circular alpha-defensins. The antibacterial activity of synthetic and isolated forms is indistinguishable. Acyclic RTD peptides are substantially less active against E. coli and S. aureus. MOA1: Theta-defensins are internalized rapidly by target bacterial cells. Theta-defensins are particularly important for antifungal activity of the granule extracts as alpha-defensins are poorly active (Tongaonkar P et al 2011 J Leuko Biol 89, 283-90). It is also active against HIV-1. MOA2: it binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520). Wild-type RTD-1 is a moderate non-competitive inhibitor of LF protease (Ki = 365  20 nM) and a weak inhibitor of other metalloproteases such as TACE (Ki = 4.45  0.48 ?M). Full sequence amino acid scanning of ?-defensin RTD-1 yields a potent anthrax lethal factor protease inhibitor. Both Cys (backbone folding) and Arg (highly conserved R4 and R13) are critical for this activity  (Li et al., 2017).

Expression: hBD-1  is constitutively expressed. Activity:While the reduced form is active against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, the oxidized form is only active against Gram- bacteria with little effect on cell envelope (Raschig J et al., 2017). hBD-1 is one of the most prominent peptides of its class but despite ubiquitous expression by all human epithelia, comparison with other defensins suggested only minor antibiotic killing activity. Interestingly, it inhibits the growth of clinical S. aureus strains but NOT lab strains. It was observed that hBD-1 from human platelets can cluster bacteria and signals NETs formation (Kraemer BF et al. 2011 PLoS Pathog Nov 7). This AMP is a salt-sensitive antibiotic in lung that is inactivated in cystic fibrosis (Cell. 1997 Feb 21;88(4):553-60). It is VERY interesting that after reduction of disulphide-bridges, hBD-1 becomes a potent AMP against the opportunistic pathogenic fungus C. albicans and against anaerobic, Gram-positive commensals of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. It seems to work using a different mechanism from hBD-3 (mainly on membranes). For a full story, please refer to Schroeder BO et al Reduction of disulphide bonds unmasks potent antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 1 Nature. 2011 Jan 20;469(7330):419-23 (APD recommended reading). Apoptosis. This AMP shows synergistic effect with LL-37 or lysozyme against S. aureus and E. coli (Chen X et al 2005 J Dermatol Sci 40: 123-32). Structure nmr+x: it contains one helix and three beta-strands linked by three disulfide bonds (NMR: Bauer F et al. 2001 Protein Sci 10:2470, use the PDB link; X-ray: Hoover DM et al 2001 J Biol Chem 276:39021-6; PDB: 1IJV). You can rotate, zoom, and view the NMR structure here in the PDB . You can view the crystal structure here.  Chemotactic: chemotactic effects of hBD-1 is achieved via the CCR6 receptor  expressed on
immature dendritic cells and CD45RO+ and CD4+ T cells (Pazgier M et al., 2007). The CCR6-mediated chemotaxis surface is defined by the N-terminal alpha-helical region (Asp(1)... Ser(8)) and a few topologically adjacent residues (Lys(22), Arg(29), and Lys(33)). Channel inhibitor: HBD1 was found to selectively inhibit human and mouse Kv1.3 channels with IC50 values of 11.8  3.1 uM and 13.2  4.0 uM, respectively (Feng J et al., 2016). Relationship with human diseases High hBD-1 is an accurate predictor of short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (Mani et al., 2018). In colonic epithelial cells, hBD-1 is supressed by the EGFR-ERK-MYC axis (Bonamy et al., 2018).

MccJ25 (formerly Mcc25) is the single representative of the immunity group J.  Four plasmid genes (plasmid-encoded) are required for MccJ25 biosyntheis: mcjA encodes the precursor protein, mcjB and mcjC encode two processing enzymes to generate mature peptide, and mcjD encodes the immunity protein (McjD), a member of the ABC transporter family. Immunity is achieved by active efflux of the processed peptide.  Bacterial mutants resistant to MccJ25 can taken in the peptide via the outer membrane protein FhuA (the iron siderophore receptor) and inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbD, ExbB and SbmA. (MOA): It works by dual mechanism, interaction with RNA polymerase or membrane respiratory enzyme chain(Bellomio et al., 2007). 
Old Structure: Originally proposed as a head-to-tail cyclic peptide (Blond 1999). Current structure (2003): MccJ25 has an unusual lariat-protoknot (""threaded lasso"") structure consisting of an eight aa residue ring formed between the backbone NH of residue Gly1 and the side chain CO of residue Glu8 (XXCsb) (Wilson et al, 2003; Rosenqren et al., 2003). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. The 13-residue tail loops back and pass through the ring and locked via aromatic rings of residues F19 and Y20 (see the structure in PDB). Systematic structure-activity analysis of MccJ25 revealed that only three in the ring and one in the tail are important for this peptide production. Furthermore, two residues in the ring and four in the threaded segment of the tail are essential for transcription inhibition (JBC 2008; 37: 25589-25595). It showed prolong effect in an animal model:mouse infection model  (Lopez et al., 2007). The crystal structure of this peptide in complex with  the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) has also been determined (Braffman et al., 2019). MccJ25 binds deep within the secondary channel in a manner expected to interfere with NTP substrate binding. 
This lasso fold is used as a stable peptide scaffold for grafting therapeutic peptides to enhance peptide stability (Hegemann et al., 2014).

Thus, inhibition of the HOG pathway holds promise as a broad strategy for increasing efficacy of antimicrobial peptides against C. albicans (Hayes BM, et al. 2013). Updated 5/2013.

The additional five residues appeared not to have a significant effect on antimicrobial activity (Dijk A et al 2009 Mol Immun. 46: 2465-2473).

Antibacterial activities of other synthetic peptides: the N-terminal 15 residues are most potent, peptide residues 1-21 and peptide residues 12-26 are weakest; substitution of P by G only reduced activity slightly, but a change of Pro by Leu greatly reduced antibacterial activity. The potent peptides can kill bacteria rapidly in 5-10 minutes. Of interest, peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 or residues 12-26 showed poor hemolytic activity.

FK-16 was demonstrated to have anticancer activity in vitro in 2006 (see the ref) and in vivo in 2013 against colon cancer cells (Ren SX et al. 2013). FK-16 shows antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against a variety of pathogens after covalently immobilized to the titanium surface (Mishra and Wang, 2017). FK-13 is the core antimicrobial peptide corresponding to residues 17-29 (sequence: FKRIVQRIKDFLR) of LL-37.  Reversal of the sequence of FK-13 led to an LL-37-derived aurein 1.2 analog (LLAA, i.e retro-FK13; sequence RLFDKIRQVIRKF), which remained active against E. coli (Li X et al. 2006 Biochim Biophys Acta 1758: 1203-1214). While FK-13 is also active against HIV-1, retro-FK13 is not (Wang G et al. 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 52: 3438-3440). However, anti-HIV GI-20, corresponding to residues 13-32 of LL-37 with the positions of I13 and G14 swapped (GIKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLV), showed the highest therapeutic index.  17BIPHE2 was designed based on the 3D structure of GF17d3 (Wang et al., 2014). 17BIPHE2 is active against the ESKAPE pathogens (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM), including E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. GF-17, GI-20, and 17BIPHE2  inhibited Zika virus (He et al., 2018). Updated 4/2013; 10/2013; Jan2014; 4/2016; 4/2017;3/2018; 6/2019.

Also Active against P. aeruginosa (MIC 40 uM) and S. aureus (MIC >160 uM) (Strmstedt et al., 2017). The overall fold is important for anti-HIV activity, since the acyclic permutant is inactive. Kalata B1 also has uterotonic and insecticidal activity (natural pesticide). (MOA) An all D-analog is also active, supporting membrane targeting (Sando L. et al. 2011 Chembiochem 12: 2456-62). NMR studies of the ternary complex identified amino acid residues in loop 5 (W23, P24, and V25) and loop 6 (L2, P3, and V4) are important for membrane binding (Shenkarrev ZO et al. 2006 FEBS J 273:2658-72). It binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and leads to pore formation (41-70 A) in lipid bilayers (Huang et al 2009 JBC 284: 20699-20707). Oligomerization on the membrane surface could be important for this process. Note that oxidized forms of this peptide have also been reported. Trp can be oxidized to oxindolylalanine I (oia) or N-formylkynurenine (nfk). The effect of such oxidation on activity is unknown (Plan MR et al 2007 Chembiochem 8:1001-11).

Active against B. anthracis (MIC 16 uM), B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, E. faecalis, S. carnosus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes (MIC 40-100 uM). It also has spermicidal effect (Silkin L Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2008 May 15;18(10):3103-6) as well as antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 (Torres NI et al., Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins. 2013 Mar 1;5(1):26-35; Quintata VM et al. 2014 J APPl Microbiol;  doi: 10.1111/jam.12618).

The NMR structure consists of five helices in a globular fold. In addition, three crystal structures in complex with different ligands have also been saved into PDB (IDs: 1O82; 1O83; 1O84) (see J Mol Biol 334: 541-549, 2003). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB . Of note, the circular structure is required for structure and stability, but less essential for activity. The molecule might have already been perfectly designed by nature (Sanchez-Hidalgo M et al 2011 Cell Mol Life Sci 68:2845-57).  AS-48 is a good candidate as a natural food preservative. Enterocin 4 has the same sequence as enterocin AS-48, but the former is only active against Gram-positive bacteria (Joosten HM et al 1996 Appl Environ Microbiol 62, 4220-3).

The two polypeptide chains work synergistically. The primary structures of both lacticin 3147 peptides were then fully assigned by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, showing that lacticin 3147 A1 has a specific lanthionine bridging pattern which resembles the globular type-B lantibiotic mersacidin, whereas the A2 peptide is a member of the elongated type-A lantibiotic class. In addition, residue L-Ser9 in chain A1 was converted to D-Ala, while both residues L-Ser9 and L-Ser12 are converted to D-Ala residues in chain A2 (PNAS 2005; 102: 18584-18589). These D-amino acids are essential for antimicrobial activity of lacticin 3147. Also obtained by NMR were solution conformations of both lacticin 3147 peptides, indicating that A1 may adopt a conformation similar to that of mersacidin with multiple turns (some locked by thioether bonds) and that the A2 peptide adopts a alpha-helical structure in the middle with turns or extended structures at termini (see Fig. 7 in the ref).

E. coli TldD and TldE interact to form a heterodimeric metalloprotease. TldD/E cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence from the modified MccB17 precursor peptide, to yield mature antibiotic, while it has no effect on the unmodified peptide (Ghilarov D et al., 2017). Escherichia coli sbmA can recognize perhaps the thiazole rings to internalize the peptide which targets DNA gyrase.

Synthetic peptides without the N-terminal Glycine-rich domain are strongly stabilize the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex with icreased potency.

The isolated peptide with N-terminal 4-aa truncation might be a further processed product.  Since 2016, cathelicidin-BF is also called cathelicidin-WA (reason unknown). Importantly, it showed low toxicity against human blood cells.  NMR structure in TFE  was not presented due to incomplete restraints. Segments KF1-11, KF12-19, and KF20-30 had no activity. Active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 2.3 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC278953 (MIC 1.2 uM), S. aureus ATCC2592, and C. albicans (MIC 4.7 uM). Salt-insensitive: The activities did not change much in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. The peptide and its lysine 16 variant also possesses anticancer effects (Tian Y et al. 2013). A derivative called BF-15 was designed. BF-15 is composed of the N-terminal 10 amino acid residues (162KFFRKLKKSV172 of the precursor) of the peptide and another successive linked 5 amino acid residues (157VKRFK161 of the precursor) from the precursor amino acid sequence of BF-30. This peptide also inhibits E. coli ATP synthase (Azim et al., 2016). Cbf-K(16), Cbf-A(7), and Cbf-A(13) were obtained by mutating Lys(16), Ala(7), and Ala(13) of BF-30, respectively.

In addition to antimicrobial activity, the peptide also inhibits trypsin due to the disulfide-bonded trypsin inhibitory loop in the sequence (enzyme inhibitor) (Li J et al 2007 FASEB J 21: 2466-73). In this proteomic paper, 372 cDNA sequences of antimicrobial peptides were found in a single frog. Among them, 107 are new peptides. Approximately 40 peptides were synthesized and tested. Only 24 peptides with antimicrobial acitivities (APD entries 1291-1314) were registered into this database. OBR1 is active against E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 5.83 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC2592 (MIC 5.83 ug/ml), B. dysenteria (1.84 ug/ml), and C. albicans ATCC2002 (2.4 ug/ml).

Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid. Because TCs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of L. lactis, the mechanism of TC-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation.  TC-1 is obtained by truncating 2 residues from the C-terminus of NAP-2. The structure of NAP-2 was determined by both X-ray and NMR (NMR+x). The protein is a tetramer (see the PDB link below) in the crystal (Malkowski MG,et al., 1995). Since the functional form is a monomer, NMR was utilized to study the soultion structure and backbone dynamics of the monomeric form of the protein in the presence of a 2-chloroethanol -water solvent (Young H et al. 1999). While both ends of NAP-2 are disordered, the middle region contains a three-stranded beta-sheet followed by a well-defined helix. A comparative NMR relaxation analysis reveals a less mobile Asp70 at the C-terminus of NAP-2, probably due to electrostatic interactions with the helix portion. In constrast, the C-terminal tail of TC-1 remains disordered. Such dynamics difference between NAP-2 and TC-1 may explain in part the higher antimicrobial acitivity of TC-1 (Nguyen LT et al. 2011). Likewise, insertion of an acidic residue to the N-terminus of GF-17 also substantially reduced its antibacterial activity (Wang G et al., 2012 ). In both cases, one acidic amino acid decreased the membrane perturbation potential of the peptides (Wang G et al., 2005 JBC) and made them less effective to target the negative surface of bacteria.

Normally, this AMP is expressed at a low level, but its expression is increased by Drechmeria coniospora infection (or by physical injury and by osmotic stress). For infection and wounding, the induction is dependent on a p38 MAP kinase cascade, but for osmotic stress, this pathway is not required. A pathway involving fatty acid synthesis and the evolutionary conserved wnk?1 and gck?3/Ste20/GCK?VI kinases modulates nlp?29 expression in the C. elegans epidermis, independently of p38 MAPK signaling. Therefore, the control of the antimicrobial peptide gene nlp?29 links fatty acid metabolism, osmoregulation, maintenance of epidermal integrity and the innate immune response to infection (Virulence. 2010 Dec 22;1(3):113-122).

Sublancin does not react with iodoacetamide demonstrating it does not contain free thiols. However, after treatment with TCEP, four out of five cysteines became accessible for alkylation.  Cys-22 glycosylation (glucose attachment) is essential for antimicrobial activity. There is only one thioether ring between T19-C22 but two disulfide bonds (C7-C36 and C14-C29). Such bridges confer superior stability to this peptide (no degradation after storing in water at room temp for TWO years!) (see the ref). Active against S. aureus and B. subtilis.

Interestingly, microbisporicin A2 shares the same amino acid sequence with A1 with the only difference being that Pro14 is only monohydroxylated at position 4.  MOA: Microbisporicins A1 and A2 displayed similar antibacterial activity by selectively blocking peptidoglycan biosynthesis, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of the UDP-linked precursor.  NAI-108 is a bromonated variant of NAI-107. It is obtained by inclusion of KBr in the production medium of either the Actinoallomurus or the Microbispora producer.

However, a change of P11 to R, removal of N19, and C-terminal amidation led to a potent (MIC 4-8 ug/ml) antibacterial peptide called oncocin (Knappe D et al 2010 J Med Chem 53: 5240-5247). Oncocin is particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii).  The 3D structure for the complex between oncocin and a portion of the E. coli heat shock protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The AMP was found to bind to the beta-strand region of the protein (Knappe D et al. 2011 ChemBioChem 12:874). However, it was not clear how this binding kills bacteria. More recently, it is demonstrated that oncocins can also bind the 50S subunit of the 70S ribosome, thereby providing a more likely mechanism that inhibits protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015). You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with ribosome here in the PDB.

Capistruin is endoded by the capABCD gene cluster, where capA encodes the precursor polypeptide, capB cleaves the presursor and is likely to promote the cyclization, capC encodes an enzyme that activates the side chain of Asp9 for cyclization, and capD encodes a immunity protein. Showed activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. Different from the lasso structure of MccJ25, where the N-terminal Gly forms an amide bond with the carboxyl group of Glu8, capistruin forms a 9-residue macrolactam ring formed between NH of Gly1 and the carboxylic side chain of Asp9.

Importantly, this CD8+ T cells derived chemokine inhibits a broad spectrum of HIV isolates. MOA:HIV: this inhibition occurs at the early stage of infection and blocks viral attachment and subsequent entry by direct interaction with the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Structure: You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the all-beta dimerhere in the PDB. However, this metamorphic protein can adopt two conformations (classic and alternative) and only the alternative, all-beta conformation (dimer) is HIV-active, while the monomer (consisting of 3 strans and one helix) activates the receptor XCR1 for chemotactic effects. The all-beta dimer variant of XCL1 binds to proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) (provided by Dr. Brian F. Volkman). Residues W55, K42, and R43 are essential for anti-HIV activity. In addition, R18, R35, and K46 are also important for HIV inhibition. Remarkably, most of these positively charged side chains are clustered on the active protein surface, but disociated in the classic chemokine fold, thereby providing a structural basis for HIV inhibition and anti-HIV drug design (Guzzo C et al. 2015). Protein engineering: Interestingly, introducing a disulfide bond between A36C and A49C mutants locks the chemokine conformation to the all-beta dimeric form (dubbed CC5), which is indeed a potent HIV inhibitor with high affinity to heparin (Fox JC et al., 2015).

In the natural form, there are multiple Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), which are represented here as lysines. The molecule is cyclic due to the formation of an amide bond between the amino group of Dab in position 4 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminus. Residue Leu6 is a D-amino acid and the N-terminus is attached by a fatty acid (Polymyxin E1= colistin A: fatty acid A=6-methyloctanoic acid; Polymyxin E2=colistin B: fatty acid B=6-methylheptanoic acid). Activity: It preferentially binds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and disrupts membranes (Moser et al., 2014).  Because of such interesting properties, there is interest in developing polymyxin analogs. AMPs in use:  Colistin sulfate:  for oral and topical use. Sodium colistimethate (CMS): for parenteral and inhalation routes. CMS is a prodrug which converts to colistin in vivo. It is less potent and less toxic.  Colistin, used alone or in combination, is important to treat Gram-negative infections such as CF involving P. aeruginosa.  Polymyxins also promote the release of histamine and serve as safe mucosal adjuvants that enhance vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses (for example ovalbumin intranasally immunized mice; Yoshino N et al., 2013).

Interestingly, CD spectra suggest a beta structure in liposomes containing aninoic lipid PGs (Balhara V et al., 2013). Note that the peptide is random coil in water, but adopted a helical structure in DPC, indicating structural plasticity.  GL13K is obtained by substituting 3 residues (Q2, N5, and D11) of GL13NH2 with lysines. The PSP (Parotid secretory protein) peptide GL13NH2 (sequence GQIINLKASLDLL), which corresponds to a lipopolysaccharide-inhibiting peptide from LBP, binds lipopolysaccharides (BBL) and agglutinated bacteria.  GL13NH2 is a potential dual-function host defense salivary protein with agglutination and anti-inflammatory activity (Gorr SU et al. 2011), but it did not kill bacteria.  Its lysine analog, GL13K, however, is active against P. aeruginosa (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 5 ug/ml), S. gordonii (MIC 64 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 41 ug/ml) (Harmouche N et al., 2017). It has low hemolytic activity. Animal model:mouse: GL13K protects mice from LPS-induced sepsis (Abdolhosseini M et al. 2012).

Also active against human C. albicans but not human bacteria. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs are highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection and located in the extracellular compartment, suggesting a role in host defense (Weerawanich et al., 2018). In addition, OsAFP1 functions by chelating cadmium in the cytosol and facilitating its secretion into extracellular spaces, lowering the cytosolic cadmium concentration and concomitantly driving long-distance cadmium transport through xylem vessels. Crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement in 2020.Residues Arg1, His2, Leu4, Arg9, and Phe10 play critical roles in OsAFP1 dimer formation.

CD spectrum with a negative band at 205 nm supports beta-structure. Active against P. falciparum (IC50 43-49 uM).   Knockdown of DEFB130 expression in macrophages resulted in a reduced antiplasmodial activity in vitro. Animal model:mouse: Treating the mice with DEFB130 synthetic peptide resulted in a temporal decrease in parasitemia P. yoelii in vivo,, which can be explained by the number of drug administration.  Thus, DEFB130 might be one of the macrophage effector molecules for eliminating malarial parasites.

Interestingly, citrocin is more potent against a pathogenic strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) than it is against laboratory strains of E. coli.  Similar to microcin J25, it has an eight aa residue ring formed between the backbone NH of residue Gly1 and the side chain CO of residue Glu8. NMR study reveals that the C-terminal tail is sterically locked into place with Arg-17 above the ring and Tyr-18 below the ring. A change of R17 to Y made the peptide inactive. This peptide must cross both the outer membrane and the inner membrane to find a cytoplasmic target such as RNA polymerase, which citropin is good at inhibiting in vitro.
